# CSC231---System-Programming-Final-Project-submission
I developed a real-time Human Detection and Motion Analysis system in Python. It uses Gaussian filtering, HOG for human detection, optical flow and Harris corners for motion tracking, and a CNN to classify walking, running, and standing. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and NumPy.
